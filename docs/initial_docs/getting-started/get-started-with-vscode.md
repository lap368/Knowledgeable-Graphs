# Using Foam with VS Code Features

Foam builds on Visual Studio Code's powerful editing capabilities, integrating seamlessly with VS Code's native features to create a comprehensive knowledge management experience. This guide explores how to leverage VS Code's built-in functionality alongside Foam.

### Keyboard shortcuts

VS Code supports various **keyboard shortcuts**, the most important for us are:

| Shortcut      | Action                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `cmd+N`       | create a new file             |
| `cmd+S`       | save the current file         |
| `cmd+O`       | open a file                   |
| `cmd+P`       | use quickpick to open a file  |
| `alt+D`       | open the daily note for today |
| `alt+H`       | open the daily note for a day |
| `cmd+shift+P` | invoke a command (see below)  |

For more information, see the [VS Code keyboard cheat sheets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-reference), where you can also see how to customize your keybindings.

### Commands

Commands make VS Code extremely powerful.

To invoke a command, press `cmd+shift+P` and select the command you want to execute.
For example, to see the Foam graph:

- press `cmd+shift+P` to open the command bar
- start typing `show graph`
- select the `Foam: Show Graph` command

And watch the magic unfold.

To see all foam commands, type "foam" in the command bar.
For more information on commands, see [commands on the VS Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).

### Panels

Foam integrates with VS Code panels to provide insights into individual notes and the whole knowledge base.

- **`Foam: links`**: Shows all notes that link to and from the currently active note, helping you understand connections and navigate your knowledge graph
- **`Foam: Orphaned Notes`**: Displays notes that have no incoming or outgoing links, helping you identify isolated content that might need better integration
- **`Tag Explorer`**: Shows all tags used across your workspace in a hierarchical view, see [[tags]] for more information on tags
- **`Foam: Graph`**: Visual representation of your note connections (also available as a separate graph view)

### Styling and Themes

VS Code is very configurable when it comes to themes and style. Find your ideal set up by running the command `Color Theme`.
For more information see the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/themes).

### Multi-Cursor Editing

Edit multiple locations simultaneously for efficient note management:

**Basic Multi-Cursor:**

- `Alt+Click` / `Option+Click` - Add cursor at click location
- `Ctrl+Alt+Down` / `Cmd+Option+Down` - Add cursor below
- `Ctrl+Alt+Up` / `Cmd+Option+Up` - Add cursor above
- `Ctrl+D` / `Cmd+D` - Select next occurrence of word
- `Ctrl+Shift+L` / `Cmd+Shift+L` - Select all occurrences

**Bulk wikilink creation:**

1. **Select a word** (e.g., "Python")
2. **Press `Ctrl+Shift+L`** to select all occurrences
3. **Type `[[]]`** to wrap all instances
4. **Arrow key** to position cursor inside brackets

### Find and Replace

Powerful search and replace for note maintenance:

**Basic Find/Replace:**

- `Ctrl+F` / `Cmd+F` - Find in current file
- `Ctrl+H` / `Cmd+H` - Replace in current file
- `Ctrl+Shift+F` / `Cmd+Shift+F` - Find across workspace
- `Ctrl+Shift+H` / `Cmd+Shift+H` - Replace across workspace

### Text Folding

Organize long notes with collapsible sections:

**Folding Controls:**

- **Click fold icons** in the gutter next to headings
- `Ctrl+Shift+[` / `Cmd+Option+[` - Fold current section
- `Ctrl+Shift+]` / `Cmd+Option+]` - Unfold current section
- `Ctrl+K Ctrl+0` / `Cmd+K Cmd+0` - Fold all
- `Ctrl+K Ctrl+J` / `Cmd+K Cmd+J` - Unfold all

## File Management

### Explorer Integration

Leverage VS Code's file explorer for note organization:

**File Operations:**

- **Drag and drop** files to reorganize
- **Right-click context menus** for quick actions
- **New file/folder** creation with shortcuts
- **Bulk selection** with Ctrl+Click / Cmd+Click

**Quick File Actions:**

- `Ctrl+C` / `Cmd+C` then `Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V` - Copy/paste files
- **Right-click â†’ Reveal in Explorer/Finder** - Open in file system

### Quick Open

Rapid file navigation for large knowledge bases:

**Quick Open Commands:**

- `Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P` - Go to file

- `Ctrl+T` / `Cmd+T` - Go to symbol in workspace
- `Ctrl+G` / `Cmd+G` - Go to line number

**Search Patterns:**

```
# Go to File (Ctrl+P)
machine       # Finds "machine-learning.md"
proj alpha    # Finds "project-alpha.md"
daily/2025    # Finds files in daily/2025 folder

# Go to Symbol (Ctrl+Shift+O)
@introduction # Jump to "Introduction" heading
@#setup       # Jump to "Setup" heading
:50           # Go to line 50
```

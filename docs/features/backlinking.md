# Backlinks

Backlinks are one of Foam's most powerful features for knowledge discovery. They automatically show you which notes reference your current note, creating a web of interconnected knowledge that reveals surprising relationships between your ideas.

## What Are Backlinks?

A backlink is a connection from another note that points to the note you're currently viewing. While you create forward links intentionally with `[[wikilinks]]`, backlinks are discovered automatically by Foam.

### Forward Links vs. Backlinks

**Forward Links** (what you create):

```markdown
# Machine Learning Note

I'm studying [[Neural Networks]] and [[Deep Learning]] concepts.
```

**Backlinks** (what Foam discovers):
If you're viewing the "Neural Networks" note, Foam shows you that "Machine Learning Note" links to it, even though you didn't explicitly create that reverse connection.

This bidirectional linking creates a richer knowledge network than traditional hierarchical folders.

## Accessing Backlinks - Connections Panel

The Connections panel shows both forward links and backlinks:

1. **Open Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. **Type "connections"** and select "Explorer: Focus on Connections"
3. **Use the filter buttons** to show only backlinks, forward links, or all connections

## Using Backlinks for Knowledge Discovery

### 1. Finding Unexpected Connections

Backlinks often reveal relationships you didn't consciously create:

**Example:** While reviewing a "Productivity" note, backlinks might show connections from:

- A cooking recipe (time management for meal prep)
- A fitness routine (efficient workout planning)
- A work project (team productivity strategies)

These diverse connections can spark new insights and cross-domain learning.

### 2. Identifying Important Concepts

Notes with many backlinks are often central to your thinking:

- **Hub concepts** that connect many ideas
- **Frequently referenced** resources or definitions
- **Bridge topics** that span multiple domains

### 3. Building Context Around Ideas

Backlinks provide context for how you use concepts across different areas:

- How you apply the same principle in various projects
- Evolution of your thinking about a topic over time
- Different perspectives you've encountered on the same idea
